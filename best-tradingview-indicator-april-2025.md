I wasn’t even planning on writing this…
…but I just need to vent this out somewhere because I’ve hit that point where I don’t know if I’m crazy or if everyone else is just pretending.

Scalp trading has been driving me nuts for the last 6 months. I’ve tried literally everything. YouTube tutorials, free indicators, paid signal groups, flipping between RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, even weird custom TradingView scripts I found on Reddit that barely work.

It’s like every time I think I figured something out, it stops working the next day.

I wake up early, check charts before work, stay up at night watching candles move sideways just to maybe catch a 0.5% gain... and then I either miss the move or get caught on a fakeout and lose it all back.

I’ve blown two accounts already. Not huge ones, but still — it’s the kind of money that stings when you’re just trying to do something productive with your time instead of scrolling TikTok.

What really pisses me off is the fake optimism everywhere. “Trading changed my life.” “Just stay consistent bro.” Like okay… consistent losses? Because that’s all I’ve gotten.

Then this random guy in a Telegram chat I’m in — I don’t even know him — drops a screenshot of a trade he took. Clean setup. Entry looked early, exit was right before it reversed. I asked what indicator it was and he just said, “custom script, AI-based.”

I rolled my eyes, but I was curious. I’ve seen enough hype tools to know what BS smells like. But this one looked… different. The setup wasn’t perfect, but it made sense. He said it alerts before the move and doesn’t repaint.

I looked into it and ended up trying it out - https://vipindicators.xyz/

Not gonna lie — it actually worked. First couple paper trades hit target within 15 minutes. Then I used it for real with tiny position size. Caught a move on GBP/USD that made back part of what I lost last week.

Is it perfect? No. But it’s the first thing I’ve used that doesn’t just feel like guessing.

I’m not saying it’ll fix everything. I still need to work on risk management. I still overthink sometimes. But when I shut up and just follow the tool, it’s cleaner than anything I’ve used.

This isn’t a review or a pitch. I don’t even know why I’m typing this, honestly. I just wanted someone to hear it. Like if you’re out here losing trade after trade and thinking you’re the problem — you’re not.

The space is full of trash. Sometimes one thing just clicks. Maybe it’s a mindset shift. Maybe it’s the right setup at the right time. Maybe it’s dumb luck.

Either way, this week I finally didn’t feel like an idiot.

That’s all.
