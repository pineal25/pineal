I wasn’t even trying to scalp the markets… it just kinda happened.

I was messing around with short-term trades because swing trading felt too slow, but nothing I used gave me consistent wins.
Tried moving average crosses. RSI setups. Even those YouTube “buy this when that turns green” junk indicators. Most of them just repainted or came too late.

Honestly? I was losing small amounts over and over, which is somehow more frustrating than a big loss. Death by a thousand cuts.

Then I found something that didn’t feel like the usual recycled indicator garbage.
It was a scalping tool built with AI — I know, sounds buzzwordy — but this one was different. It wasn’t just a repackaged EMA or cloud indicator.
It gave buy/sell signals in real-time with stop loss + take profit suggestions built in.

What caught my attention was the setup: 1 minute. No config, no strategy stacking.
Just load it into your TradingView, wait for the signal, and execute.
I don’t have time to babysit 4 screens like I’m on Wall Street, so this was a game changer.

I started running it on BTC and ETH using the 5-min and 15-min charts.
Out of 10 trades, I was winning 8 or 9. Which felt… weird. Like something finally clicked.

Then I tossed it on GBP/USD — same thing. Scalps. In and out. Profit.
After a week, I knew this wasn’t luck.

This is the one I’m using now:

Not hyping it. No pitch. It’s just the only indicator that actually helped me get consistent with scalping after months of trying random strategies.

It works on TradingView (free account is fine), and comes with some full beginner-friendly course stuff too, but honestly, I never watched the videos.
Just followed the signals and kept the risk small.

I’m not gonna pretend this is some get-rich trick. You still need patience and risk control.
But if you’ve been stuck in that loop of testing free tools that suck — this might be the break you need.

Hope this helps someone else stuck in that same cycle.
